### Executive Summary

Our Problem is accurately predicting 3-year cumulative oil production for pre-production wells. To address the problem, our team built a geology-informed machine learning pipeline combining engineered subsurface features with an ensemble of XGBoost, Ridge, and neural network models. Through this experience, our team learned a lot about testing different models and working together of AI/ML projects. Moving forward, we will plan more and stay more structured.

___

### Workflow Goal

Our goal is to develop a robust, generalizable pipeline to predict cumulative 3-year oil production for unseen wells by blending physics-driven geological insight with machine learning and uncertainty modeling.
